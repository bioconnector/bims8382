## Basic R Setup

**Note:** R and RStudio are separate downloads and installations. **R** is the underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no fun. **RStudio** is a graphical integrated development environment that makes using R much easier. You need R installed before you install RStudio.

1. Download data. fixme.
1. **Install R.** You'll need R version 3.1.2 or higher. Download and install R for [Windows](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) or [Mac OS X](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) (download the latest R-3.x.x.pkg file for your appropriate version of OS X).
1. **Install RStudio.** Download and install the latest stable version of [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
1. **Install R packages.** Launch RStudio (RStudio, *not R itself*). Ensure that you have internet access, then enter the following commands into the **Console** panel (usually the lower-left panel, by default). _A few notes_:
    - These commands are case-sensitive. 
    - Even if you've installed these packages in the past, go ahead and re-install the most recent version. Many of these packages are updated often. For instance, [ggplot2 2.0](http://blog.rstudio.org/2015/12/21/ggplot2-2-0-0/) (released December 2015) came with many new features and changes.
    - At any point (especially if you've used R/Bioconductor in the past), R may ask you if you want to update any old packages by asking `Update all/some/none? [a/s/n]:`. If you see this, type `a` at the propt and hit `Enter` to update any old packages. 
    - If you're using a Windows machine you might get some errors about not having permission to modify the existing libraries -- don't worry about this message. You can avoid this error altogether by running RStudio as an administrator (right click the RStudio icon, then click "run as administrator").

```r
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("tidyr")
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("stringr")
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("broom")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

You can check that you've installed everything correctly by closing and reopening RStudio and entering the following commands at the console window:

```r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(stringr)
library(knitr)
library(broom)
library(rmarkdown)
```

These commands may produce some notes or other output, but as long as they work without an error message, you're good to go. If you get a message that says something like: `Error in library(packageName) : there is no package called 'packageName'`, then the required packages did not install correctly. Please do not hesitate to email me _prior to the course_ if you are still having difficulty.

## Bioconductor

Additionally, you'll need to install a few [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) packages. These packages are installed differently than "regular" R packages from CRAN. Copy and paste these lines of code into your R console.

```r
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite()
biocLite("DESeq2")
```

You can check that you've installed everything correctly by closing and reopening RStudio and entering the following commands at the console window:

```r
library(DESeq2)
```

If you get a message that says something like: `Error in library(packageName) : there is no package called 'packageName'`, then the required packages did not install correctly. Please do not hesitate to email me _prior to the course_ if you are still having difficulty.

## Additional steps for Reproducible Research classes

A few additional setup steps required for the reproducible research / dynamic documents class.

1. First, launch RStudio (not R). Click File, New File, R Markdown. This may tell you that you need to install additional packages (knitr, yaml, htmltools, caTools, bitops, and rmarkdown). Click "Yes" to install these.
1. Sign up for a free account at **[RPubs.com](http://rpubs.com/)**.
1. If you want to convert to PDF, you will need to install a **LaTeX** typesetting engine. This differs on Mac and Windows. **Note that this part of the installation may take up to several hours, and isn't strictly required for the class.**
    - **Windows LaTeX instructions**:
        1. Download the installer [using this link](http://mirrors.ctan.org/systems/win32/miktex/setup/setup-2.9.5721.exe). It is important to use the full installer, not the basic installer. Run the installer .exe that you downloaded.
        1. Run the installer _twice_, making sure to use the Complete, not Basic, installation:
            1. First, When prompted, select the box to "Download MiKTeX." Select the closest mirror to your location. If you're doing this from Charlottesville, the United States / JMU mirror is likely the closest. This may take a while.
            1. Run the installer again, but this time select "Install" instead of "Download." When prompted _"Install missing packages on-the-fly"_, drag your selection up to "Yes."
    - **Mac LaTeX instructions**:
        1. Download the installer .pkg file [using this link](http://tug.org/cgi-bin/mactex-download/MacTeX.pkg). This is a very large download (>2 gigabytes). It can take a while depending on your network speed.
        1. Run the installer package.
