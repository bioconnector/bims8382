Contemporary life science is plagued by reproducibility issues. This workshop covers some of the barriers to reproducible research and how to start to address some of those problems during the data management and analysis phases of the research life cycle. In this workshop we will cover using R and dynamic document generation with RMarkdown and RStudio to weave together reporting text with executable R code to automatically generate reports in the form of PDF, Word, or HTML documents.

This section assumes a [basic familiarity with R](r-basics.html), [data frames](r-dataframes.html), [manipulating data with dplyr and `%>%`](r-dplyr.html), and [plotting with ggplot2](r-ggplot2.html). It also assumes that you've successfully installed all packages on the [R setup page](setup-r.html), including the [additional steps](setup-r.html#additional-steps-for-reproducible-research-classes) needed specifically for this class.

Finally, see [this course's help page](help.html#markdown-rmarkdown-resources) for links to getting more help with reproducible research, Markdown, and RMarkdown.

## Who cares about reproducible research?

Science is plagued by reproducibility problems. Especially genomics!

- Scientists in the United States spend [$28 billion](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002165) each year on basic biomedical research that cannot be repeated successfully.[^spending]
- A reproducibility study in psychology found that only [39 of 100 studies could be reproduced](http://www.nature.com/news/first-results-from-psychology-s-largest-reproducibility-test-1.17433).[^psych]
- The Journal _Nature_ on the [issue of reproducibility](http://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-1.17552):[^natureonrep]
    - "_Nature_ and the Nature research journals will introduce editorial measures to address the problem by improving the consistency and quality of reporting in life-sciences articles... **we will give more space to methods sections. We will examine statistics more closely and encourage authors to be transparent, for example by including their raw data.**"  
    - _Nature_ also released a [checklist](http://www.nature.com/authors/policies/checklist.pdf), unfortunately with _wimpy_ computational check _(see #18)_.
- On microarray reproducibility:[^microarrayrep]
    - 18 Nat. Genet. microarray experiments
    - Less than 50% reproducible
    - Problems: 
        - Missing data (38%)
        - Missing software/hardware details (50%)
        - Missing method/processing details (66%)
- NGS: run-of-the-mill variant calling (align, process, call variants):[^ngsrep]
    - 299 articles published in 2011 citing the 1000 Genomes project pilot publication
    - Only 19 were NGS studies with similar design
    - Only 10 used tools recommended by 1000G.
    - Only 4 used full 1000G workflow (realignment & quality score recalibration).

Consider this figure:

How do we reproduce it? What do we need?

- The [data](https://github.com/bioconnector/bioconnector.github.io/blob/master/data/gapminder.csv)
    - Data points themselves
    - Other metadata
- The [code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bioconnector/workshops/master/lessons/r/r-viz.Rmd) fixme
    - Should be readable
    - Comments in the code / well-documented so a normal person can figure out how it runs.
    - How were the trend lines drawn?
    - What version of software / packages were used?
    
This kind of information is rarely available in scientific publications, but it's now extraordinarly easy to put this kind of information on the web.

Could I replicate Figure 1 from your last publication? If not, what would _you and your co-authors_ need to provide or do so I could replicate Figure 1 from your last publication?

**As scientists we should aim for _robust_ and _reproducible_ research**

- "**Robust research** is about doing small things that stack the deck in your favor to prevent mistakes." _-Vince Buffalo, author of Bioinformatics Data Skills (2015)_.
- **Reproducible research** can be repeated by other researchers with the same results. 

### Reproducibility is hard!

1. Genomics data is too large and high dimensional to easily inspect or visualize. Workflows involve multiple steps and it's hard to inspect every step.
1. Unlike in the wet lab, we don't always know what to expect of our genomics data analysis.
1. It can be hard to distinguish *good* from *bad* results.
1. Scientific code is usually only run once to generate results for a publication, and is more likely to contain silent bugs. (code that may produces unknowingly incorrect output rather than stopping with an error message).

### What's in it for _you?_  

Yeah, it takes a lot of effort to be robust and reproducible.  However, *it will make your life (and science) easier!*

- Most likely, you will have to re-run your analysis more than once.  
- In the future, you or a collaborator may have to re-visit part of the project.
- Your most likely collaborator is your future self, and your past self doesn't answer emails.
- You can make modularized parts of the project into re-useable tools for the future.  
- Reproducibility makes you easier to work and collaborate with.  

### Some recommendations for reproducible research

1. **Write code for humans, write data for computers.** 
    - Code should be broken down into small chunks that may be re-used.  
    - Make names/variables consistent, distinctive and meaningful.  
    - Adopt a [style](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) be consistent.[^style]
    - Write concise and clear comments. 
1. **Make incremental changes.** Work in small steps with frequent feedback. Use version control. See <http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/> for resources on version control.
1. **Make assertions and be loud, in code and in your methods.** Add tests in your code to make sure it's doing what you expect. See <http://software-carpentry.org/v4/test/> for resources on testing code.
1. **Use existing libraries (packages) whenever possible.** Don't reinvent the wheel. Use functions that have already been developed and tested by others.
1. **Prevent catastrophe and help reproducibility by making your data _read-only_.** Rather than modifying your original data directly, always use a workflow that reads in data, processes/modifies, then writes out intermediate and final files as necessary.
1. **Encapsulate the full project into one directory that is supported with version control.** See: Noble, William Stafford. "A quick guide to organizing computational biology projects." [_PLoS Comput Biol_ 5.7 (2009): e1000424](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424).
1. **Release your code and data.** Simple. Without your code and data, your research is not reproducible.
    - GitHub (<https://github.com/>) is a great place for storing, distributing, collaborating, and version-controlling code.
    - RPubs (<http://rpubs.com/>) allows you to share dynamic documents you write in RStudio online.
    - Figshare (<http://figshare.com/>) and Zenodo (<https://zenodo.org/>) allow you to upload any kind of research output, publishable or not, free and unlimited. Instantly get permanently available, citable DOI for your research output.
    - _"Data/code is available upon request"_ or _"Data/code is available at the lab's website"_ are completely unacceptable in the 21st century.
1. **Write code that uses relative paths.**
    - Don't use hard-coded absolute paths (i.e. `/Users/stephen/Data/seq-data.csv` or `C:\Stephen\Documents\Data\Project1\data.txt`). 
    - Put the data in the project directory and reference it _relative_ to where the code is, e.g., `data/gapminder.csv`, etc.  
1. **Always set your seed.** If you're doing anything that involves random/monte-carlo approaches, always use `set.seed()`.
1. **Document everything and use code as documentation.**
    - Document why you do something, not mechanics. 
    - Document your methods and workflows.
    - Document the origin of all data in your project directory.
    - Document **when** and **how** you downloaded the data.
    - Record **data** version info.
    - Record **software** version info with `session_info()`.
    - Use dynamic documentation to make your life easier.

## RMarkdown

RMarkdown is a variant of Markdown that lets you embed R code chunks that execute when you compile the document. What, what? Markdown? Compile? What's all this about?

### Markdown

Ever heard of HTML? It's what drives the internet. HTML is a _markup language_ - that's what the _ML_ stands for. The terminology evolved from "marking up" paper manuscripts by editors, where the editor would instruct an author or typesetter how to render the resulting text. Markup languages let you annotate **text** that you want to display with instructions about how to display it. 

I emphasize **text** because this is fundamentally different than word processing. When you use MS Word, for example, you're creating a special proprietary binary file (the .docx) file that shows you how a document looks. By contrast, writing in a markup language like HTML or Markdown, you're writing plain old text, using a text editor. The toolchain used to render the markup text into what you see on a display or in a PDF has always been and will always bee free and open. 

You can learn Markdown in about 5 minutes. Visit **[bioconnector.org/markdown](http://bioconnector.org/markdown)** for a quick-start reference and links to other resources. Let's open up a web-based Markdown editor like <http://dillinger.io/> or use a desktop Markdown editor like [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) (Windows) or [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) (Mac).

### RMarkdown workflow

RMarkdown is an enhanced version of Markdown that lets you embed R code into the document. When the document is compiled/rendered, the R code is executed by R, the output is then automatically rendered as Markdown with the rest of the document. The Markdown is then further processed to final output formats like HTML, PDF, DOCX, etc.
