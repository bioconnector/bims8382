title: "Homework: Learn Markdown"
---

The goal of this quick homework is to learn a little bit about _Markdown_ prior to our lesson on reproducible research. All you really need to know is that Markdown is a lightweight markup language that lets you create styled text (like **bold**, _italics_, [links](http://bioconnector.org/markdown), etc.) using a very lightweight plain-text syntax. The resulting text file can be _rendered_ into many downstream formats, like PDF (for printing) or HTML (websites).

1. _(30 seconds)_ Read the summary paragraph on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). 
1. _(5-10 minutes)_ Run through this in-browser markdown tutorial: <http://markdowntutorial.com/>.
1. _(5-10 minutes)_ Go to <http://dillinger.io/>, an in-browser Markdown editor, and play around. Write a simple markdown document, and export it to HTML and/or PDF.
1. _(5-10 minutes)_ Take a look at the Markdown/Rmarkdown reference for this course: <http://bioconnector.org/markdown>. Scroll through the Markdown reference, which you've already seen by this point, then click the RMarkdown link at the top and skim through this. 
1. _(0 seconds)_ No need to look now, but don't forget that the course [help page](help.html) has some [useful resources on Markdown+RMarkdown](help.html#markdown-rmarkdown-resources).
